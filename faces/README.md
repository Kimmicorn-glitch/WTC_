# faces.py

## Purpose
Takes text with emoticons like :) and :( and replaces them with emojis ðŸ˜„ and ðŸ˜¢.

## How It Works
1. Get text input from the user.
2. Replace :) with ðŸ˜„ and :( with ðŸ˜¢.
3. Output the upgraded text â€” now with more emotional range.

## Struggles
- The replacement order mattered: replacing :) first worked, but if done in reverse, the face got *mutilated*.
- Initially forgot that .replace() can be chained.

## Lesson Learned
- Order of operations isnâ€™t just for maths.
- Chaining .replace() can be neat if you keep it in the right sequence.

## Example
I am happy :) but also sad :( â†’ I am happy ðŸ˜„ but also sad ðŸ˜¢
