# Professor (number guessing game)

## What it does
Binds a guess game in which the computer randomly selects an integer and the user must guess it. The computer provides feedback until the user guesses the number correctly.

## What I struggled with 
- Proper input validation so non-integer inputs will not crash the program.
- Outputs formatting exactly enough to pass check50.

## How I solved it
- Labeled a helper function to prompt and check for integer input with `try/except` loops.

## Fun fact / Humour
My program is more helpful than some professors. 

## How to run
```bash
python professor.py
```
