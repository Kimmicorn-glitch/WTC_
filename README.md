# CS50 Python Projects – Kimberley Bezuidenhout

## Overview
Welcome to my collection of CS50 Python projects! This repo documents my journey through Harvard’s Introduction to Programming with Python, where I learned to bend strings, wrangle numbers, tame loops, and occasionally argue with my code until it agreed with me.  

From quirky programs like faces.py and playback.py to practical exercises like bitcoin.py and meal.py, these projects represent the steps I took to level up as a Python programmer.

## My Journey & Struggles
1. **Getting back into Python:** After a short break, I had to remind my brain that strings are immutable and indentation is not optional. This meant lots of trial-and-error and small REPL experiments.  

2. **Input validation nightmares:** User input is tricky. I repeatedly had to handle empty strings, invalid numbers, and unexpected formats. Lesson learned: always sanitize before you analyze.  

3. **Transformation logic:** Programs like `faces.py` and `twttr.py` taught me that the order of operations matters—a lot. One wrong replacement and your emojis turn into gibberish.  

4. **Time comparisons and formatting:** In `meal.py` and `fuel.py`, comparing hours and fractions was a puzzle. Converting everything to consistent formats saved the day.  

5. **APIs and real-world data:** `bitcoin.py` was simultaneously thrilling and terrifying. Handling requests, exceptions, and JSON data tested my attention to detail—and my patience.  

6. **Avoiding overcomplication:** It’s tempting to write nested loops for everything. Many times, the simplest solution (built-in functions, single loops, dictionaries) was the best.

## How I Solved Problems
- **Break it down:** I tackled one requirement at a time instead of getting overwhelmed by the full spec.  
- **Test small:** I used REPL and print statements to validate each function.  
- **Use Python’s built-ins:** .replace(), .lower(), dictionaries, and .split() often replaced 20+ lines of overengineered code.  
- **Read the docs:** CS50 lectures, Python documentation, and Stack Overflow were lifesavers.  
- **Iterate:** Writing a solution, failing, then improving repeatedly is part of the learning curve (and part of the fun).

Note: Some of these programs are simple, some are weirdly fun, and some are just me talking to Python until it does what I want. No semicolons were harmed in the making of these projects, and yes, I may have rolled my eyes at a few `ValueError`s along the way.
